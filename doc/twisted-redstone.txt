Twisted Redstone is a mod that provides a superior alternative to the vanilla
redstone "wiring" mechanic by allowing you to run wires as opposed to
sprinkling dust on blocks and hoping the signal arcs :)

The mod introduces no worldgen but is Forge ore dictionary aware and can make
use of certain metals if they are made available.

Single Pair
-----------

The core item provided by the mod is the redstone wire. Basic single pair wire
will carry a redstone signal up to 32m from the original source without any
boosting. Wires may be placed horizontally or vertically, with as many bends as
necessary to reach the destination.

The recipe for basic wire is a pair of iron bars and six redstone in this
pattern:

+---+---+---+  The end result is 8 units of uninsulated single pair wire.
| R | R | R |  
+---+---+---+  This wire is grey with red flecks that (ideally) glow when a
| I |   | I |  signal is being carried. The signal is directional from its
+---+---+---+  origin, and will otherwise interact with adjacent blocks as
| R | R | R |  normal redstone - but will not transmit a signal through solid
+---+---+---+  blocks.

It is possible to substitute gold or any of the standard Forge metals for iron
in this recipe: copper, tin, silver, lead.

NB: A concept of high vs low resistance wire is in the works whereby copper,
silver, and gold would produce a higher quality wire than iron, tin, and lead.

Insulation
----------

A set of twisted pair of wire may be insulated by crafting 8 wire in a circle
around a unit of insulation (or the insulation may optionally be included in
the original wire recipe to the same effect).

+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+  W = uninsulated wire
| W | W | W |      | R | R | R |  N = insulation (any)
+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+  R = redstone
| W | N | W |  or  | I | N | I |  I = iron bar
+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
| W | W | W |      | R | R | R |
+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+

Insulation is crafted from a piece of iron fencing placed between two pieces
of wool. The wool may be either 2 of the same color (resulting in a solid 
colored wire) or 1 white and 1 of a different color (resulting in a striped
wire).

Wires of different colors will not normally connect to eachother. They will,
however, connect to noninsulated wire. Insulated wire will also not connect
to machines except at the endpoint (which makes it useful for running a signal
past something you do not want to accidentally trip). Insulated wire has a
range of 64m (up from the 32m of uninsulated).

Cat5 Cable
----------
By combining 8 different colors of wire, one can produce Cat5 cable. This cable
can carry 8 different signals at once. For traditional reasons, the insullation
color combinations required to make this class of cable are:

Solid Green, Striped Green, Solid Orange, Striped Orange, Solid Blue, Striped
Blue, Solid Brown, Striped Brown.

These also happen to use the most common vanilla dyes (cactus, both types of
flowers, lapis, and cocoa). Because the recipe is so involved, it is shapeless.
The end result is 4 units of Cat5.

Apart from carrying 8 different channels in parallel, Cat5 behaves largely like
insulated wire with the exception that it will not connect directly to any
machine. It will, however splice with any wire that matches its composition,
and will send that channel's signal down that link.

Cable Jack
----------
An RJ45 jack serves as an endpoint to a Cat5 cable and will allow it to connect
to a machine. The jack may be tuned to an individual channel or to the entire
signal (though there is not much that can use the whole signal). Jacks have a
concept of facing and will emit their programmed redstone signal in their
programmed direction.

It is possible, therefore, to run Cat5 along the back of a row of machines, and
attach the machines to the cable via a series of jacks, each programmed to a
different channel of the cable. The machines may then be remotely controlled
individually.

+---+---+---+  Jacks are constructed from glass panels and a single unit of
|   |   |   |  Cat5 cable. For the recipe, you get two RJ45.
+---+---+---+  
| G |   | G |
+---+---+---+  G = glass pane
| G | C | G |  C = cat5 cable
+---+---+---+

Patch Panel
-----------
A patch panel is a block with a programmable UI that allows you to splice the
different wires of a cable together. Thus, it might be possible to cross the
White-Green and Blue wires as they pass through this block. Every color may
be spliced with one other color. By splicing them all in sequence, you can
completely gum up everything ;)

+---+---+---+  A single patch panel is made from 6 RJ45 jacks, some uninsulated
| J | S | J |  wire, and some smooth stone.
+---+---+---+
| J | W | J |  J = rj45 jack
+---+---+---+  S = smooth stone
| J | S | J |  W = uninsulated wire
+---+---+---+

Because of the directional nature of twisted redstone signals, the panel may
be used directionally. Thus, if White-Green splices over to Blue but Blue is
not configured to splice to outgoing White-Green, an WG signal into the panel
will emit both WG and Bl but a Bl signal into the panel will only emit Bl on
the other side.

Toggle Jack
-----------
A toggle jack is am RJ45 jack that can receive a redstone signal from another
source to turn it off and on - every redstone pulse switches its behavior. A
disabled jack will not emit a signal even when it receives one from its
programmed input.

Toggle jacks are crafted by combining a regular jack with a lever.

Beyond the features listed above, not much is planned seriously other than the
possibility of some cosmetic or logistical changes.

Cat3 cable
 - A cheaper alternative to full-blown Cat5. Only uses WG, G, WO, O channels.
 - Would otherwise function identically

PoTR
 - Power over Twisted Redstone
 - Allows sending as many as 3MJ/t over a Cat5 cable, with each 0.5MJ/t of
   authorized power consuming one channel (6 channels for power, 2 for control)
   - Alternatively, each powered channel may carry 1.5kW of UE
   - With a Cat3 cable, only two channels may be used for power
 - PoTR Jack, allows both energy to be input/output and may still function as
   a normal jack.
   - NB: Jacks on both ends of a PoTR signal needn't be programmed to the same
     redstone channel - thus different inputs/outputs may be used for control
 - Requires low resistance cables, otherwise power transmission will fail
   - Jack should attempt to detect a full low-resistance link to another jack
     and display any errors on the ui

Pulse Generator
 - A pulse generator is a programmable clock that emits redstone pulses on a
   selected delay of between 50 and 5000 ticks. The pulse generator has facing
   similar to a cable jack.
 - It is constructed by combining a clock, an uninsulated wire, and a button.

Toggle Cable
 - Cable with a builtin switch that allows a player (or a redstone signal) to
   manually enable/disable it.
 - PoTR will likewise be disabled.
 - Recipe: cable + lever

ComputerCraft integration
 - Allow computers to either toggle individual channels by name or by numeric
   bitmask.
 - Allow computers to identify the analog strength of the signal arriving over
   any given channel.

Blinkenlights
 - A block that displays the 8 channels as blinkenlights
 - Recipe: 8 torches + cable

Diode Wire/Cable
 - Wire/Cable that only allows signal to travel one way
